This folder is for reuseable user-defined Eidos functions that provide useful additional functionality to SLiM models.  At present, it contains:

readMatrix.txt : read a matrix of values from a file and return it, using readCSV() and DataFrame.asMatrix()

twoHabitatMap.txt : constructing a 2D spatial map algorithmically, with two habitats connected by a corridor

rgnorm.slim : demonstrates the use of system() to draw from a generalized normal distribution (not supported intrinsically in Eidos), using Python
