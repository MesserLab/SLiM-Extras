  This reads in the file at path with readCSV(), using a comma separator by default.  The file should not have a header row, and all rows should contain the same number of values of the same type (i.e., be a well-formed matrix of values).  The DataFrame returned by readCSV() is converted to a matrix with asMatrix() and returned.
