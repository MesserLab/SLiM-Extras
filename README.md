# SLiM-Extras
Extra add-ons that may be useful for people using SLiM, but that are not part of the SLiM project itself.

---------------

This repository is for all sorts of extras associated with SLiM that others might find useful.  That could include:

- user-defined Eidos functions that could be reused in new SLiM models
- full SLiM models that we don't want to include as recipes in the manual, but that might nevertheless be useful
- code for reading or analyzing SLiM output, or translating it into other file formats
- installation scripts and related information

Contributions to SLiM-Extras from SLiM users are welcome; if you have done something related to SLiM that you think others in the community might find useful, please consider contributing it here, either with a pull request on GitHub, or just by emailing us a submission.

**Note**: the `slim-community` organization at [github.com/slim-community](https://github.com/slim-community) also acts as a host for SLiM-related content from the community.  It is more of a host for whole repositories â€“ self-contained projects, rather than just little throwaway user-defined functions, models that provide a simple example of an idea or technique, and minor extensions of material from the SLiM manual.  But the line is fuzzy!  If a contribution is big enough that it feels like it merits its own repository, rather than just being a file or two in a folder with other stuff, then perhaps it belongs in `slim-community`.

SLiM is under active development, and our goal is to make it as broadly useful as possible.
