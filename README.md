# SLiM-Extras
Extra add-ons that may be useful for people using SLiM, but that are not part of the SLiM project itself

---------------

This repository is for all sorts of extras associated with SLiM that others might find useful.  That could include:

- user-defined Eidos functions (new in SLiM 2.5!) that could be reused in new SLiM models
- full SLiM models that we don't want to include as recipes in the manual, but that might nevertheless be useful
- code for reading or analyzing SLiM output, or translating it into other file formats
- code for sublaunching multiple SLiM processes in various computing cluster environments, for replication or exploration of a parameter space
- anything else we can think of, really.

Contributions to SLiM-Extras from SLiM users are welcome; if you have done something related to SLiM that you think others in the community might find useful, please consider contributing it here, either with a pull request on GitHub, or just by emailing us a submission.
